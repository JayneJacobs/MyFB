# Space Complexity


Space complexity efficiency of  code for memory used.
Space and time Complexity are related

For example, consider the following code :

```vector<int> V;

for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) V.push_back(i);
```


The code snippet ends up creating a vector of size N. So, space complexity of the code is 
```O(N)```

Additional space / memory is measured as:
       - most memory used by a program at runtime. 

If you allocated O(N) memory
space complexity of your program is not O(1) when memory is freed
